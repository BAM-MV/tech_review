## Astronaut Career Tracking System (ACTS)

ACTS is used as a tool to maintain a record of all the People that have served as Astronauts. When serving as an Astronaut, your *Job* (Duty) is tracked by your Rank, Title and the Start and End Dates of the Duty.

The People that exist in this system are not all Astronauts. ACTS maintains a master list of People and Duties that are updated from an external service (not controlled by ACTS). The update schedule is determined by the external service.

## Definitions

1. A person's astronaut assignment is the Astronaut Duty.
1. A person's current astronaut information is stored in the Astronaut Detail table.
1. A person's list of astronaut assignments is stored in the Astronaut Duty table.

## Requirements

##### Enhance the Stargate API (Required)

The REST API is expected to do the following:

1. Retrieve a person by name.
1. Retrieve all people.
1. Add/update a person by name.
1. Retrieve Astronaut Duty by name.
1. Add an Astronaut Duty.

##### Implement a user interface: (Optional)

The UI is expected to do the following:

1. Successfully run a console, web, or application without errors.
1. Implement call(s) to retrieve an individual's astronaut dutys.
1. Display the progress of the process and the results in a visually sophisticated and appealing manner.
